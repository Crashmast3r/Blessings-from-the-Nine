## App Discription

When run in Node this app should put out a message with 3 randomized elements.
The randomized Elements here are: an offering, 1 of the Nine and a blessing.

## Project Goal

This project is a trainging from Codecadamy.com.
It is meant to be practice for javascript syntax and understanding. 
Besides that it's also practice for version control with git/github.
And off course practicing Markdown, hence this readme file XD.

## Project Status

Code is functioning.
Need to add more options for offers and blessings and still need to ad 7 more Divines.
Needs a better output message, the latest was just for testing.
